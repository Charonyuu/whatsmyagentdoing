# 👀 whatsmyagentdoing

**A Claude Code / Codex skill: type `/myoffice` and see what every Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI and Copilot agent on your machine is doing — live, in a little office.**

<sub>Recorded with `--demo` (a made-up team), so no real sessions are shown.</sub>

## Install

**Easiest: ask your agent.** Paste this into Claude Code or Codex:

> Install the myoffice skill from https://github.com/Charonyuu/whatsmyagentdoing: clone it with `git clone --depth 1` into `~/.claude/skills/myoffice` (for Codex: `~/.codex/skills/myoffice`), check that `node --version` is 18 or newer, then tell me to start a new session and type /myoffice.

Or do it yourself:

```bash
# Claude Code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Charonyuu/whatsmyagentdoing ~/.claude/skills/myoffice

# Codex
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Charonyuu/whatsmyagentdoing ~/.codex/skills/myoffice
```

Then type **`/myoffice`** (or just ask *"what are my agents doing?"*). The office opens in your browser. Update later with `git -C ~/.claude/skills/myoffice pull`.

Needs Node.js 18+. Nothing to `npm install` — the repo runs as cloned. Prefer no skill? `node bin/cli.js` from a clone works too.

It opens an isometric **office**. Agents that are working sit at cubicle desks: a thought bubble while thinking, typing with code scrolling on the monitor while a tool runs, standing up and waving when they need you. A handful of recently finished agents stay around off duty and wander: coffee and water in the pantry, the couch and beanbags, the bookshelf, the meeting-room whiteboard, the arcade cabinet, ping-pong and foosball (when two of them are free), the phone booth, or a nap at an empty desk. Everyone else has gone home. The windows follow your local time of day (and in Medium there's an office cat). Hover anyone to see what they're on.

Two looks: **Medium** is a hand-drawn 2D canvas (zero dependencies). **High (3D)** renders the same office with real-time lighting and shadows using [Kenney](https://kenney.nl)'s CC0 *Mini Characters* (with their walk / sit / interact animations) and *Furniture Kit*; drag to rotate, scroll to zoom. The 3D bundle (three.js, ~180 KB gzipped) and models (~1.3 MB, meshopt-compressed) only load when you pick High.

Prefer plain cards? Switch to **List**. Either way, each session updates in real time:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 💭 Thinking | reasoning, or reading a tool result |
| ⏳ Running | a tool call is in flight — shows which (`Bash: npm test`, `Edit app.ts`, `github · create_pr`) |
| ✍️ Writing reply | started its answer, turn not finished yet |
| 🟠 Waiting for you | asked you a question / needs approval |
| ✅ Done | turn finished, with the last reply |
| ■ Interrupted / ❗ Error / – Idle | |

The UI speaks English, 繁體中文, 简体中文, 日本語, 한국어, Español, Français, Deutsch and Português. By default it uses the language you write your prompts in (falling back to your browser's); pick one from the 🌐 menu to override.

In list view, sessions are grouped into **Needs you → Working → Finished**, with a live timer for the current turn, a copy button for the resume command (`claude --resume …` / `codex resume …`), optional browser notifications when an agent finishes, and filters for Claude / Codex / Copilot / subagents. The tab title shows how many agents are working.

Works with Claude Code (CLI, desktop, IDE), Codex (CLI, desktop, IDE), Gemini CLI and Copilot / VS Code agent sessions — anything that writes session logs to disk. Copilot sessions are labeled `workspace-<foldername>` so sessions from different project folders are easy to distinguish. The dashboard also injects the current VS Code Copilot session so the active agent can appear in the office immediately. (Google Antigravity keeps its conversations in an undocumented binary store and isn't supported yet.)

## Options

```
-p, --port <n>    Port (default 4545; next free one if taken)
--hours <n>       Sessions active in the last n hours (default 24)
--no-open         Don't open the browser
--private         Hide prompts, replies and titles — status only (screen-share safe)
--json            Print one snapshot as JSON and exit
--demo            Show a made-up team instead of your sessions (screenshots, trying it out)
--stop            Stop a running dashboard (or say /myoffice stop)
```

Running it again while it's up just reopens the tab.

## How it works

No hooks, no config, no API keys. Both tools already append every message and tool call to JSONL files as they work:

- Claude Code: `~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl` (+ `subagents/`)
- Codex: `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl`
- Gemini CLI: `~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/chats/session-*.jsonl` (project paths from `~/.gemini/projects.json`)
- Copilot / VS Code: `~/.copilot/session-state/<session>/events.jsonl`

`whatsmyagentdoing` tails those files (read-only), turns the latest event into a status, and pushes it to the page over Server-Sent Events. Set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` / `CODEX_HOME` / `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` if yours live elsewhere.

**Privacy:** nothing leaves your machine. The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only and rejects requests that aren't addressed to localhost. No runtime dependencies — read `src/` in five minutes. (`web/office3d.js` is the 3D source; `npm run build` bundles it with three.js into `public/office3d.js`.)

## Limits

- Logs are written per finished block, not per token, so "Writing reply" means a reply block has landed and the turn isn't over — not a live keystroke stream.
- Claude Code doesn't log permission prompts, so a tool waiting on your approval shows as "Running" until you answer (Codex and Gemini CLI do log it, so those show "Waiting for you").
- Gemini CLI writes its thoughts together with the reply, so between your prompt and its first tool call or reply it simply shows "Thinking".
- The log formats aren't public APIs. If an update changes them, statuses may degrade — please open an issue.
